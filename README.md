# Wallpaper of this
if you'd like to get the wallpaper... well, good luck

get the files, go into index.js and change the `createCanvas(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight)` to `createCanvas(1920, 1080)` or whatever is your resolution.
then you can just wait or open console: `ctrl + shift + K` in firefox and type: `target.length = 0` then: `saveCanvas('THE_NAME_YOU_WANT')` i might at some point make a p5.js sketch for just the wallpaper
